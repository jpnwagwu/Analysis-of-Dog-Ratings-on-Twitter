# Analysis of Twitter Dog Ratings

The act_report.pdf file contains a description of my thought process and actions carried out on the dataset. This was mainly an exploratory analysis and gave me an insight into potential areas worth digging into

The wrangle_act file contains steps taken in data wrangling from downloading the data via the Twitter API, to cleaning the data for analysis
